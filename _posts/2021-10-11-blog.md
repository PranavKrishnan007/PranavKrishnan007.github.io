This is the first time I'm making a blog.🤩

 The whole experience of doing the Amfoss tasks has deepened my desire to learn about different types of languages and explore what all cool stuff I can do with them.

<h2 style="color:blue"> Tasks 0,1 and 2</h2>

I didn't have to install Ubuntu because I have MacOs which is already a UNIX based OS so I instantlly had access to the terminal
> although while doing the later tasks I realised that the readability of my terminal was not good (base terminal). So I customized it to zsh theme called "powerlevel10k" --- which has much better readability and also added autocomplete and syntax highlighting 😍 (it took good 3 hours for the whole thing to be set up)

then for the 1st task I just followed along with the detailed steps which were provided ... I had to run it twice because for some reason it didn't work the first time but yeah overall I completed it fairly easily.

task 2 again deepened my understanding of the git commands as we were instructed to use only the terminal and then post all the commands used to the repo. I did face a problem in this task but *Subith* helped me out and I was soon able to complete the task.

<h2 style="color:red">Task 5</h2>

this task seems to fairly straightforward I'm currently doing it parallelly with task 9 ie this one 😛 

<h2 style="color:green">Task 6</h2>

Ufff this task was something else to be honest.... setting up the whole thing was such a hassle + finding the code to be able to make the UI
> AND HOW MY LAPTOP WOULD START TO BOIL AS SOON AS I START ANDROID STUDIO 😂

so my fix was to not use android studio rather I opted for vscode which was little hard to figure out how to get it to work but once I did it worked like a charm.

All in all it took me good 4 days to get this task done... but watching the final outcome was incredibly satisfying

<h2 style="color:yellow">Task 9</h2>

I'm doing it right now I would say its one of the easier tasks ....but my god I actually made a whole blog in html just to realise its not working 😑 and now I'm again making it with a mix of html and markdown.

Anyway this is my first time using jekyll.... and I also saw a tutorial for hugo which also looks pretty awesome.

<h2 style="color:purple">Task 10</h2>

This is by far the most informative one like for real the way David J. Malan teaches is just awesome ... plus going through all of the lectures was just so much fun ...I've completed till lecture 3 but I would go through all the rest of the lectures as well in my free time 🤩 🤩

<h2> Additional tasks:</h2>
these tasks were fun to do, like the bandit one was awesome... gave me insight into how to quickly search for things using terminal.

And also the poster task(canva was new to me but yeah that too was fun)... its UI is very beginner friendly 😌

> While doing the tasks I realised :

> * How awesome the development side of things are 😌
> * That I'd eventually need a new lappy 😂  a decade old laptop doesn't get the job done lol
> * Its surprisingly hard to get things installed on my mac mostly because this is my first time setting up IDEs so setting paths, source files everything was a bit of a learning curve 😭
